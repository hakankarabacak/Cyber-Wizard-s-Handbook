<h1 align="center">AWESOME NOTES</h1>

#### This repository contains all of the resources, guidelines, tools that I use in my daily life and in my career. Sometimes, I like things and add them here. I believe that this repository reflects my career path because it shows what I have learned and how I improved. Thus, someday when I publish this, it can be a good resource for newbies who want to improve in this field. But the repository is private until that day.
