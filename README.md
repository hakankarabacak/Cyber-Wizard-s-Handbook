<h1 align="center">THE CYBER-WIZARD'S HANDBOOK</h1>

#### This repository contains all of the resources, guidelines, tools that I use in my daily life and in my career. Sometimes, I like things and add them here. I believe that this repository reflects my learning path because it shows what I have learned and how I improved. Thus, it can be a good resource for newbies(like me) who want to improve in this field. Have fun.
